- **Reflexivity**: every function is less, greater and equal to itself
- **Transitivity**: if one function is greater than 
- symmetry
- Transpose symmetry

###Elementary Data Structures
**Heap**
nearly complete binary tree
- lowest level is not complete
- must fill exerything from the left
- **Max-heap/Min-heap property** node value must either be greater or less than its children
